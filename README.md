# React Native Test App

React Native Test App provides test apps for all platforms as a package.

This is a work in progress. You can read and discuss the RFC at
[React Native: Discussions and Proposals](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/204).

The package is still a bit cumbersome to consume, and requires manually writing
some of the configuration. We are currently working on making it easier, and
will write documentation when it becomes ready.

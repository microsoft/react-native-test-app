## Quick Start ‚ö°

_If you want to migrate an existing test app for a library, follow the
[dedicated guide in the wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-test-app/wiki/Migrate-an-Existing-Test-App)._

Install `react-native-test-app` as a dev dependency. We will use the wizard to
generate your test app:

```sh
yarn add react-native-test-app --dev
yarn init-test-app
```

In this example, we will create a project named "sample" in `sample` with test
apps for all platforms:

```sh
‚úî What is the name of your test app? ‚Ä¶ sample
? Which platforms do you need test apps for? ‚Ä∫
Instructions:
    ‚Üë/‚Üì: Highlight option
    ‚Üê/‚Üí/[space]: Toggle selection
    a: Toggle all
    enter/return: Complete answer
‚óâ   Android
‚óâ   iOS
‚óâ   macOS
‚óâ   Windows
‚úî Where should we create the new project?? ‚Ä¶ sample
```

Run `yarn` inside the new project folder:

```sh
cd sample
yarn
```

Once the dependencies are installed, follow the
[platform specific instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-test-app/wiki/Quick-Start#platform-specific-instructions)
in the wiki.
